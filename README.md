## Introduction:
 We sought to develop a platform that facilitated easy sharing of tools and machinery between professionals. Instead of havig to buy the whole set of carpentry or plumbing tools every time we have a small job, we can just rent it from someone who is not using it at the moment for a much lower price. This is also beneficial to the lender as it serves as an extra source of side-income for the lender.
